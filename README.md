# Docker Pain-Points Dashboard

A dashboard that visualizes and tracks real user pain points with Docker, based on community feedback (e.g. Reddit, forums, GitHub). It helps product, UX, and engineering teams identify and prioritize issues by frequency, severity, and user impact.

### Features

- Pain-point categories: Networking, volumes / storage, permissions, updates, onboarding / learning curve, etc.

- Severity scoring: Each pain point gets a qualitative “severity” level (Very High, High, Medium-High, Medium) based on how critical the issue is reported to be.

- Upvotes / Community impact: Shows the number of upvotes or community reactions for sample posts, giving a sense of how many users are affected or how loudly the issue is voiced.

- Most Affected User Types: Identifies which kinds of users (beginners, intermediate, advanced; OS environments; production vs development) report each issue most frequently.

- Severity Filtering: Users of the dashboard can filter which pain points to view based on severity level(s). For example, you can toggle to show only High or Very High severity issues.

- Trend Over Time (optional / future): Track whether certain pain points are increasing or decreasing in frequency, especially after Docker version updates or fixes.

### Data Sources

- Reddit threads and community forums
